# Swiss QR Bill for .NET

Open-source .NET library to generate Swiss QR bills (jointly developed with the [Java version](https://github.com/manuelbl/SwissQRBill)).

Try it yourself and [create a QR bill](https://www.codecrete.net/qrbill). The code for this demonstration (React UI and RESTful service) can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/manuelbl/SwissQRBillDemo) as well.

This library implements version 2.2 and 2.3 of the *Swiss Implementation Guidelines QR-bill* from November 20, 2023, and *Swico Syntax Definition (S1)* from November 23, 2018.


## Introduction

The Swiss QR bill is the QR code based payment format that started on 30 June, 2020. The payment slip is sent electronically or presented online in most cases. It can still be printed at the bottom of an invoice or added to the invoice on a separate sheet. The payer scans the QR code with his/her mobile banking app to initiate the payment and then just needs to confirm it.

If the invoicing party adds structured bill information (VAT rates, payment conditions etc.) to the QR bill, the payer can automate the booking in accounts payable. The invoicing party can also automate the accounts receivable processing as the payment includes all relevant data including a reference number. The Swiss QR bill is convenient for the payer and payee.

## Getting started

1. Create a new Visual Studio project for .NET Core 3.x (*File > New > Project...* / *Visual C# > .NET Core > Console App (.NET Core)*)

2. Add the library via NuGet:

   Either via *Project > Manage NuGet Packages...* / *Browse* / search for *qrbill* / *Install*
   
   Or by running a command in the Package Manager Console

```
Install-Package Codecrete.SwissQRBill.Generator -Version 3.3.1
```

3. Add the code:

```c#
using Codecrete.SwissQRBill.Generator;
using System;
using System.IO;

namespace Codecrete.SwissQRBill.Examples.Basic
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Setup bill data
            Bill bill = new Bill
            {
                // creditor data
                Account = "CH4431999123000889012",
                Creditor = new Address
                {
                    Name = "Robert Schneider AG",
                    Street = "Rue du Lac",
                    HouseNo = "1268/2/22",
                    PostalCode = "2501",
                    Town = "Biel",
                    CountryCode = "CH"
                },

                // payment data
                Amount = 199.95m,
                Currency = "CHF",
                
                // debtor data
                Debtor = new Address
                {
                    Name = "Pia-Maria Rutschmann-Schnyder",
                    Street = "Grosse Marktgasse",
                    HouseNo = "28",
                    PostalCode = "9400",
                    Town = "Rorschach",
                    CountryCode = "CH"
                },

                // more payment data
                Reference = "210000000003139471430009017",
                UnstructuredMessage = "Abonnement für 2020",

                // output format
                Format = new BillFormat
                {
                    Language = Language.DE,
                    GraphicsFormat = GraphicsFormat.SVG,
                    OutputSize = OutputSize.QrBillOnly
                }
            };

            // Generate QR bill
            byte[] svg = QRBill.Generate(bill);

            // Save generated SVG file
            const string path = "qrbill.svg";
            File.WriteAllBytes(path, svg);
            Console.WriteLine($"QR bill saved at { Path.GetFullPath(path) }");
        }
    }
}
```

4. Run it

## NuGet packages

Swiss QR Bill generation is available as three different NuGet packages. They all include the basic QR bill generation for PDF and SVG and only differ with regards to the PNG and EMF generation.

| NuGet packages | PDF | SVG | PNG | EMF | Platform neutral | Recommendation |
| -- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | -- |
| [Codecrete.SwissQRBill.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Codecrete.SwissQRBill.Core/) | ✓ † | ✓ | – | – | ✓ | Platform-independent core without PNG and EMF generation. |
| [Codecrete.SwissQRBill.Generator](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Codecrete.SwissQRBill.Generator/) | ✓ † | ✓ | ✓ | – | ✓ | Core plus platform-independent PNG generation (based on [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp)). |

† See the note below related to PDF generation with the extended Latin character set.
 

## Changes effective November 21, 2025

On November 21, 2025, the QR bill specification 2.3 and further changes in the Swiss payment standards will become effective. The library is ready for these changes:

- QR bills may use an extended character set (*Extended Latin* instead of a subset of *Latin-1*). To enable it, use `bill.CharacterSet = SpsCharacterSet.ExtendedLatin`. Do not use it before November 21, 2025. Also see the below regaring PDF generation.
- Payments may no longer use *combined address elements* (aka unstructured addresses). In the library, the related methods have been marked as deprecated. Use structured addresses instead. Stop using unstructured addresses long before November 21, 2025 or customer will be unable to pay your bills.


## PNG generation

PNG generation requires a raster graphics library. Starting with .NET 6, the *System.Drawing* classes have become a Windows-only technology and standard .NET no longer supports raster graphics out-of-the-box. With this library, you have several options:

- If you do not need PNG generation, you can use the light-weight core library: **Codecrete.SwissQRBill.Core**.
- If you need PNG generation, you can use the enhanced version: **Codecrete.SwissQRBill.Generator**. It uses [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp) as a platform independent raster graphics library. Note that on Linux, SkiaSharp depends on native libraries that might not be installed on your machine. The easiest solution is to add the NuGet package [SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Linux.NoDependencies](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Linux.NoDependencies) to your project.
- If you creating a Windows-only software, use the **Codecrete.SwissQRBill.Windows** package. It uses the *System.Drawing* classes for PNG generation and adds EMF generation on top.


**Note:** If you receive the error message *"Graphics format PNG not available (are you missing the NuGet package Codecrete.SwissQRBill.Generator?)"* and you are already using **Codecrete.SwissQRBill.Generator** or **Codecrete.SwissQRBill.Windows**, add this code to your project:

```
CanvasCreator.Register(new PNGCanvasFactory());
```

It prevents Visual Studio from removing the **Codecrete.SwissQRBill.Generator** or **Codecrete.SwissQRBill.Windows** library from the final application (and only including the **Codecrete.SwissQRBill.Core** library). Visual Studio likely behaves like this because the PNG generation code is not statically referenced, but discovered and loaded at run-time. So it might think the library is not needed. This problem has only been observed with .NET Framework 4.x and only if the application does not reference **Codecrete.SwissQRBill.Generator** or **Codecrete.SwissQRBill.Windows** directly but indirectly through a class library project.


## PDF generation

To generate QR bills as PDF files, this library uses its own, minimal PDF generator that requires no further dependencies and comes with the same permissive license as the rest of this library.

The built-in PDF generator does not support font embedding and is thus restricted to the standard 14 PDF fonts, which in turn are restricted to the WinANSI character set. This is sufficient to generate QR bills using the original character set (a subset of Latin-1). However, it is insufficient to generate QR bills using the extended Latin character set (allowed from November 21, 2025). If the extended character set is to be used, use one of the below options.

The libary can be integrated with [iText](https://itextpdf.com/en) or [PDFsharp](http://www.pdfsharp.net/). See the example projects for more information:

- iText: https://github.com/manuelbl/SwissQRBill.NET/tree/master/Examples/iText
- PDFsharp: https://github.com/manuelbl/SwissQRBill.NET/tree/master/Examples/PDFsharp

These examples also support adding a QR bill to an existing PDF document.


## Code examples

This library comes with multiple code examples:

- [Basic](Examples/Basic): A basic example showing how to generate a QR bill.

- [WindowsForms](Examples/WindowsForms): An extensive example showing how to use this library in a Windows Forms application (display of QR bills on the screen, printing, working with the clipboard).

- [WindowsPresentationFoundation](Examples/WindowsPresentationFoundation): An example for Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) applications. It shows how to display and print QR bills.

- [WinUI](Examples/WinUI): An example for WinUI applications. It shows how to display and print QR bills.

- [MicrosoftWordAddIn](https://github.com/manuelbl/SwissQRBill.NET/tree/master/Examples/MicrosoftWordAddIn): Implements an add-in for Microsoft Word capable of inserting a QR bill as a resolution independent EMF graphics. As C# add-ins use the *Microsoft Word Interop* interface, this example is also relevant for other software interacting with Microsoft Word.

- [iText](Examples/iText): Example showing how to generate PDFs using the [iText](https://itextpdf.com/en) library, including how to add a QR bill to an existing PDF document.

- [PDFsharp](Examples/PDFsharp): Example showing how to generate PDFs using the [PDFsharp](http://www.pdfsharp.net) library, including how to add a QR bill to an existing PDF document.

## More information

This library is the .NET version of Swiss QR Bill. There is also a [Java version](https://github.com/manuelbl/SwissQRBill) with the same features. More information about both libraries can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/manuelbl/SwissQRBill/wiki).
